# tv100

Combinators for data processing

This library combines two activities: validation and transformation (V and T).
Since two letters is too short and I don't like long names, I needed something a
bit longer than 'vt' or 'tv'. Handily there's prior art in this area:

> The VT100 is a video terminal, introduced in August 1978 by Digital Equipment
> Corporation (DEC). It was one of the first terminals to support ANSI escape
> codes for cursor control and other tasks, and added a number of extended codes
> for special features like controlling the LED lamps on the keyboard.

It amused me holding up the VT100 as an example of something worthy of naming
a library after, so here it is.

## Why?

When it comes down to it, we only deal in data and code, and in lisp, code is data.

As part of the search for "how to make programming less tedious", I realised that I
spend a lot of time validating and transforming data, so I combined them into one
activity as an experiment and in doing so created a convenient base upon which to
build a bunch of other useful modules I'm planning. Hope you like it.

## Usage

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/irresponsible/tv100/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/irresponsible/tv100)

```clojure
(ns myapp
  (:use [irresponsible.tv100]))

(def my-data-structure {:foo [{1 2}]})

(def validator
  "A very quickly composed validator that roughly resembles the structure"
  (comp tvmap? (tv-keys tvkey?)
        (tv-vals (comp tvvec? (tv-map comp tvmap? (tv-zip tvint? tvint?))))))
```

## Clojurescript support

Just works! Obviously you have to :require rather than :use as in the example.

The following functions are currently unimplemented:

* tvint? (try tvfloat?, i haven't figured out what to do about ES6 ints yet)
* tvclass? (javascript doesn't have a special 'class' type)
* tv-isa? (because it almost certainly wouldn't do what you want it to)
* tv-instance? (because i haven't written it yet)

## Docs

Sorry, just inline at the minute, but they're good quality.
